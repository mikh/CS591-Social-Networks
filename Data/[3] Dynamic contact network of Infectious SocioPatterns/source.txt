DATASET: Infectious SocioPatterns dynamic contact networks
Release data: Nov 28, 2011
This dataset contains the daily dynamic contact networks collected during the Infectious SocioPatterns event that took place at the Science Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, during the artscience exhibition INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY. Each file in the downloadable package contains a tab-separated list representing the active contacts during 20-second intervals of one day of data collection.  Each line has the form “t i j“, where i and j are the anonymous IDs of the persons in contact, and the interval during which this contact was active is [ t – 20s, t ]. If multiple contacts are active in a given interval, you will see multiple lines starting with the same value of t. Time is measured in seconds and expressed in UNIX ctime.
This dataset is the dynamic counterpart of the daily cumulated contact networks available here.
